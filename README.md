# RadReact
Radiation reaction project from 2018
Simulates ultra-relativistic electrons using C code. Very very inaccurate for high fields although high velocities work just fine.
For best results compile on linux. The documentation for the project is a work in progress including detailed instructions and safe initial parameters.
